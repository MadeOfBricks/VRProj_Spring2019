Seeker pull
	While mark visible
	If mark is green
	Tug with only one hand towards enemy
	Move player to 
	arm_length + sword_length - some_amount
	distance away from the enemy
	Remove mark


Do we just warp, or dash and stop?
	Dash and stop would feel cool
	moveState of "homingDash"
		during that move state, 
		cannot mark new enemies
		or unmark current ones
		
		Get direction towards enemy
		Set speed and riection towards enemy
			We may have to add a seperate point on their body to move towards
		

How do we implement air hang?
Let's not worry about that
Enemies can move along the ground for now
