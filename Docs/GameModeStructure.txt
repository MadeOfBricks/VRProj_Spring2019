How do we escalate the game?

"GameManager" node
  At start of game, have player in middle with no abilities available until they hit the "Begin" button
    Probably in "Menu" mode
  

  When an enemy dies, signal the manager to check remaining number of enemies
  If it hits zero, start countdown timer
  At end of timer, reset scene
  Regenerate environment every 2-3 rounds?
