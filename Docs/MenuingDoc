Need version of player for menus
  var userMode
    Can be "Menu","Game","GameMenu"
  "Menu" used for just-menu scenes like the main menu
    Sword cannot be drawn
    Let's not be thinking about menu secrets at this point in development
  "Game" for being in a level during gameplay
    Usual player abilities and capabilities
  "GameMenu" for bringing up the menu during gameplay
    Sword is set to invisible, menu is brought up
    Leave movement abilities available for now
    Parent node of menu will be child of Player
  Surface with menu buttons
    Touch finger to button to highlight it
    Raycast from head to a node on hand detects whether or not the hand is in/on menu surface
      Raycast node on hand is under the fingers + some distance X
      This node is an area
    Each button has a collision area that extends X + some distance Y (maybe .4) behind the surface of the button
    Probably not necessary to do the Sprint-Vector-Style quality of life menu
    Interaction between hand node and menu button
      Create "BaseButton" class with default values and todos
    MainMenu
      "Empty Grove"
        Test scene with trees for movement demonstration
        Training dummy that respawns at different locations
        After hitting it at every location, a party hat appears on it?
          Goddamnit man
      "Hostile Grove"
        Usual game mode
