****TEST A****
Test whether we can be "too fast"
  See if sword can just destroy on contact



Sword moves
  Check change in position on
    Blade edge point (BEP)
    Blade back edge point (BBEP)
    Handle
	
To be a valid hit
  Handle must travel X distance
  Direction of movement of BEP must be opposite the direction
  towards BBEP
  angle_to must be greater than 150(to start off)

So we always need to track
  Previous blade handle position
  Previous blade edge position
  Previous back side of blade position

Depending on how Test A goes
  Frame where sword first contacts enemy body
    Check for valid hit from last frame to this one
  For every frame where sword is first in contact with enemy body
    Check for valid hit form last frame to this one
    Count every delta's worth of seconds we spend doing invalid hits
  Frame where sword is no long contacting enemy body
    Check for seconds spent doing invalid hits
    If it exceeds some amount Z (let's start with .05 seconds, then
    tweak it as necessary)
