Presentation
Intro
	Who here has played a VR game?
	Which one? x3

Simple, spoken, no powerpoint
	What I set out to do
		What VR games can do
			Physical immersion and engagement
		
		What I wanted to do with that
			Fun combat
			Bit of a workout

Demonstrate In Playground
	"Now for the part of the presentation that some of you may have been anticipating: The part
	where I wobble back and forth and flail my arms around wearing VR equipment."
	
	Movemement-heavy combat in a crowd
		What is the closest we can get to DMC in VR?
	The mechanics that do that
		Basics
			Tracks hands and hands
			Need to face the sensors
				Sticks turn in 45 degree snaps
				Looks jarring on the screen
		Mechanics engage player physically
			Sword that has to be swung "right"
				Most games, you can waggle a sword
				Here, I track hand movement and movement of blade relative to its edge
			Pushing gust dash
				Have to move hands certain distance
			Homing dash
				Half of a gust dash
			Ground movement
				Weaving dash requires side-to-side-movement
		
		Test the player's physical limits
			Waves escalate in difficulty

The main game
	"Now, I will drop into simple procedural environments where the trees and blocks are
	placed procedurally."
	"When I hit this button, I will start fighting one enemy"
	(does that)
	"Now two"
	(does that)
	"Now three"
	(does that)
	"And onwards"
	(Afterwards)
	"I'm not a swordsman, and I'm no exercise scientist, but I know that I have fun and work up a 
	sweat when I playtest this for extended periods of time"

The process
	Focus was on function, not form
		Simplistic menus, no vfx, basic animation, simple sword

Some issues
	Unable to implement certain player abilities
