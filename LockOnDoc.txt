When the lock-on button is hit, we need to
  Get the direction that the ARVR origin is facing
    Probably global_transform.basis.z
  Get all the enemies
  Get all the Y-Axis rotations required to make the ARVR origin face those enemies
  Decide whether we're rotating the player left or right (dir) dependent on which button was pressed
  Find the smallest dir-wards rotation required for the list of enemies
  Rotate the origin by that much
  Visual effect to indicate the enemy we've locked onto
